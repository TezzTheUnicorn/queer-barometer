# queer-data-science

In the spring of 2022 we have started to learn about queer people's experiences with their closest family members. So far we have conducted a study, written a huge report and received our fist small funding (yay!). Our goal now is to streamline the data cleaning and analysis to conduct more surveys and better interpretation.
